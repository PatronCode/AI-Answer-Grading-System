# GitHub Repository Setup

It looks like your Git repository is already initialized and the remote origin is set up, but the repository doesn't exist on GitHub yet. Here's what you need to do:

## 1. Create the Repository on GitHub

1. Go to [GitHub](https://github.com/) and sign in to your account
2. Navigate to the "PatronCode" organization/account
3. Click on the "+" icon in the top-right corner and select "New repository"
4. Enter the exact name: "AI-Answer-Grading-System"
5. Optionally add a description
6. Choose whether the repository should be public or private
7. Do NOT initialize the repository with a README, .gitignore, or license (since you already have these files)
8. Click "Create repository"

## 2. Verify Your Remote URL

```bash
# Check your current remote
git remote -v
```

Make sure it shows:
```
origin  https://github.com/PatronCode/AI-Answer-Grading-System.git (fetch)
origin  https://github.com/PatronCode/AI-Answer-Grading-System.git (push)
```

If the URL is incorrect, you can update it:
```bash
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/PatronCode/AI-Answer-Grading-System.git
```

## 3. Commit Your Changes (if not already done)

```bash
# Add all files to staging
git add .

# Commit the changes
git commit -m "Initial commit with OCR functionality using Google Vision API"
```

## 4. Push to GitHub

```bash
# Push to the master branch
git push -u origin master
```

If your default branch is named "main" instead of "master", use:
```bash
git push -u origin main
```
## Troubleshooting

If you're still having issues:

1. Make sure the repository has been created on GitHub with the exact name "AI-Answer-Grading-System"
2. Ensure you have the necessary permissions to push to the "PatronCode" organization/account
3. Try using a personal access token instead of password authentication
4. Check if there are any network issues or firewall restrictions
